# Mahilabh 
This is the code base for the official website for the mobile application for Mahilabh. Mahilabh is an impact-led project on which I worked in a team of five at Arth during my internship. I was the Product Owner of the product, with the main goal of following agile methodology and scrum framework to deliver an MVP of the Mahilabh app.
